# Generative AI Training Program

Welcome to my GitHub repository for the **Generative AI Training Program** organized by **Pak Angels**, in collaboration with **Silicon Valley, USA**! I am excited to have been successfully enrolled in this prestigious program aimed at equipping participants with the skills and knowledge required to build and deploy **Generative AI** models.

Throughout this program, I will be gaining hands-on experience and in-depth insights into **Generative AI**, exploring how these models are transforming industries such as entertainment, healthcare, and creative content generation. This repository will document my journey and showcase the work completed during the course.

## Objective

This training program aims to provide me with the knowledge and practical experience necessary to:
- Master **Generative AI** technologies, including **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**, **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)**, and **Transformer models**.
- Build and deploy models capable of generating realistic text, images, and other forms of creative content.
- Explore and apply **Generative AI** techniques to real-world problems, enhancing my ability to innovate in creative and technical fields.
  
The course emphasizes **hands-on learning**, and I will be working on various **assignments**, **projects**, and **applications** throughout the program. The repository will serve as a record of my work and provide valuable resources for others interested in **Generative AI**.
